# The Importance of Mental Health 

Society has normalised the stigmatistion of mental health conditions. It's high time we realised that there is nothing shameful about seeking help for mental conditions just as we do for physical health. This must be done with immediate action.

## Seeking Help

As students of NC State, we can reach out to
[Campus Health](https://counseling.dasa.ncsu.edu/) and schedule appointments for councelling sessions . 

Students can also reacg out to [prevention services](https://prevention.dasa.ncsu.edu/) for additional help and guidance. 

## What We Must Do as a Community   

As a community it is our responsibility to do the following:

* Spread awareness on the available mental health resources.
  * hand out brochures to people
  * encourage them to go to informative sessions
* Be kind to people. 
* Listen with no judgements
* Assure we are in this together 

## Prevention of Crisis

It is significant to remember **prevention** of a mental health crisis is always easier than curing it!

## Conclusion 

Let's agree to create a kind and collaborative space for everyone in this fight against mental health stigmatisation!
